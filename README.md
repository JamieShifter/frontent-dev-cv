# Welcome to My Homepage

This is my attempt at creating an online, always accessible Curriculum Vitae of mine.

Here's the link: [Homepage](https://jamieshifter.github.io/frontent-dev-cv/)

## What's in it?

You can find some info about me here, like who am I professionally and personally. Content is divided into sections to help you navigate(yes, there's also a navbar).
Below the main section you can find Skills table, Experience table, Education table and at the very bottom - contact form, which currently just thanks you for clicking, but of course the plan is to get it working.

Here's how it should look like:

## Dark Mode button

If your eyes are tired but you still want to check out my CV - click Dark Mode button, which should make background darker and all fonts brighter.

Here's how it should look like:

## Technologies used
* HTML of course(BEM compliant)
* CSS, multiple files for crucial elements
* JavaScript ES6, tidier after refactoring;)
